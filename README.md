# Project-Report-BMW-Global-Sales-Performance-Analysis - 2010-2024
---
## Introduction
- This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of BMW’s global sales performance, spanning from 2010 to 2024. Using a dataset containing vehicle specifications, regional sales, and pricing, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to identify key revenue drivers, consumer preferences, and market trends. The goal is to provide a high-level overview of how various factors—such as transmission type, engine size, and regional distribution—impact BMW’s bottom line.


###  Problem Statement

The automotive market is increasingly competitive and influenced by shifting consumer preferences. BMW needs to understand:

- Which vehicle configurations (transmission, engine size, color) contribute most to revenue?
- How have sales fluctuated over the last decade and a half?
- Which regions and models are underperforming or overperforming in terms of sales volume?
- The relationship between vehicle specifications and market demand.

###  Methodology

* **Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, formatted currency (USD), and standardized categorical data (Regions, Models).
* **Data Modeling:** Leveraged **Pivot Tables** to aggregate revenue and sales volume across multiple dimensions.
* **Visualization:** Created a dynamic dashboard using **Pivot Charts** (Line, Bar, and Pie charts) and integrated **Slicers** (Region, Model, Year) for an interactive user experience.
* **Key Metrics:** Total Revenue, Average Sales Volume, and Sum of Price.

###  Results & Insights

#### Financial Overview

* **Total Revenue:** The analysis shows a massive total revenue of approximately **$3.75 Billion**.
* **Sales Trend (2010–2024):** The line chart reveals significant volatility. While there was a steady period between 2012 and 2018, a sharp spike occurred around 2022, followed by a notable dip toward 2024, suggesting recent market challenges or supply chain impacts.

#### Consumer Preferences

* **Transmission:** Interestingly, **Manual transmissions** generated slightly higher total revenue compared to Automatic transmissions.
* **Model Performance:** The **7 Series** leads in sales volume percentage (approx. 9.4%), followed closely by the **i8** and **X1**. The **M3** shows the lowest relative sales volume among the top tracked models.
* **Aesthetics:** White and Silver remain the dominant color choices for consumers, significantly outperforming Red in the "Model vs. Color" distribution.

#### Technical Specifications

* Engine Size: There is a concentrated volume of sales for engines in the **1.6L to 2.6L** range. Larger engine sizes (4.1L) show lower sales volume, indicating a preference for fuel efficiency or mid-range performance.

###  Recommendations

* **Capitalize on High-End Series:** Since the **7 Series** and **i8** are volume leaders, marketing efforts should be intensified in high-growth regions to maintain this momentum.
* **Investigate Recent Declines:** The sharp revenue drop post-2022 requires a deeper dive into regional economic factors or specific model lifecycle ends.
* **Optimize Inventory by Color:** Production should continue to prioritize **White and Silver** variants, as these represent the vast majority of consumer purchases.
* **Regional Strategy:** Use the interactive slicers to identify why specific regions (e.g., Africa vs. North America) may be lagging and tailor localized promotions accordingly.

###  Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that BMW maintains a strong market position with a multi-billion dollar revenue stream. While traditional preferences like manual transmissions and neutral colors remain strong, the volatility in the 2020s highlights the need for agile, data-driven decision-making. By focusing on high-volume models and optimizing engine offerings, BMW can stabilize revenue and adapt to the evolving automotive landscape.
